## :construction:Synopsis:
This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

  * For adding trains, user need to submit the following information in left dropdown input blanks:
    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- hours and minutes
    * Frequency -- in minutes
  * This app will auto calculate the next train's arriving time after submitted above information.
  * Users from different machines could view same train times.
